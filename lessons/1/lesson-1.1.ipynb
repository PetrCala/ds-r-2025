        "1. **Data Size**: For demonstration, keep the datasets small so that everything runs quickly in class.\n",
        "2. **Student Engagement**: Encourage them to modify code, try their own filters, or fix missing data in different ways to understand the trade-offs.\n",
        "3. **Make It Real**: Journalists might enjoy using real datasets (e.g., small election datasets, public health statistics, or sample tweets). If time allows, demonstrate how to get data from a public portal (like data.gov or a relevant local open-data site).\n",
        "4. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues include read/write permissions, mismatched working directories, or missing packages. Allocate time for these sorts of setup challenges.\n",

        "By the end of this notebook, your class should have a foundation in reading data, performing essential cleaning steps, and running quick EDA. In **Lesson 2**, you’ll go further into **data reshaping, merging** with `dplyr` joins, and a practical introduction to **running SQL queries** in R."
